    <h1>Your Best</h1>
    <p>If you always try your best<br>
    Then you'll never have to wonder<br>
    About what you could have done<br>
    If you'd summoned all your thunder<br>
    </p>
    <p>And if your best<br>
        Was not as good<br>
        As you hoped it would be,<br>
        You still could say,<br>
        "I gave today<br>
        All that I had in me."
